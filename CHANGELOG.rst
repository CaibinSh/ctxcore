    * Remove unused RankingsDatabase classes and conversion functions.
    * Add CisTargetDatabase class for reading rankings/scores for
      regions/genes from a cisTarget scores or rankings database
      (only Feather v2 format), which requires pyarrow >= 8.0.0
      instead of <=0.17.1 needed for the old FeatherRankingDatabase
      class.
    * Update FeatherRankingDatabase to use CisTargetDatabase to read
      cisTarget databases.
    * Reformat code and update type annotations.


0.1.1
    * Add support for reading rankings databases created by
      create_cisTarget_databases as the index column in the
      Feather file is "motifs" or "tracks" instead of "features".

0.1.0
    * Project created.
